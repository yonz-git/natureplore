// transparent. The scroll is the background's, not the logo's: it opens the photograph, and once that
// circle is about half way out the logo starts and then plays at its own speed, whatever the scroll
// does from there. When it has built itself it stands a moment, the wordmark lifts off letter by
// letter, and the symbol alone shrinks into the top left corner; only when it lands does the rest of
// A0 come in, which is what the a0-open class below starts (app/welcome.css).

// empty corner slot, so both sizes and every window width follow the CSS.
